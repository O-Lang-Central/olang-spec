# Specification Evolution Process

O-Lang evolves through:
1. **Public feedback** on published versions
2. **RFCs** for new features or breaking changes
3. **Core Team consensus** (during pre-foundation phase)

All changes require:
- Clear problem statement
- Backward compatibility analysis
- Test case proposal
- Update to normative spec

Final decisions are recorded in merged RFCs.
