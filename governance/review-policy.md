# Public Review Policy

- Each new spec version undergoes a **minimum 2-week public review**
- Feedback must be submitted via GitHub Issues using templates
- Only **clarifications** are accepted during review of a version
- New semantics are deferred to next minor version via RFC
- Silence does not imply consent; unresolved issues block publication
