## What is O-Lang?
O-Lang is a **semantic orchestration protocol** for governing AI and automation workflows **outside application code**. It enables:
- Runtime-enforced policy
- Symbol-level semantic truth
- Deterministic, auditable execution
- Portable, language-agnostic workflows

O-Lang is **not** a developer framework, DSL, or LangChain alternative. It is a **governance layer** for AI systems.
